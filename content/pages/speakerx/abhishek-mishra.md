speaker_abstract: In the past couple of years, we’ve seen companies begin to embrace GraphQL as an alternative to REST API’s due to their expressive power and correctness guarantees.
    Since it’s introduced by Facebook, GraphQL is in contention as an alternative to REST APIs. Github has also announced GraphQL support to one of their APIs.
    Because GraphQL is not simply a evolutionary replacement for REST, this talk will help cover basics of GraphQL and how to use GraphQL with Python.
    GraphQL - It's a strongly typed query language that describes how to request data. GraphQL declares everything as a graph. You request what you want, and then you will get what you expected. Nothing more, nothing less.
    Through this talk, I'll like to discuss following points:
    - Quick walkthrough on REST
    - What's wrong with REST ?
    - Solution to solve REST issues - GraphQL
    - Why GraphQL ?
    - About GraphQL
    - REST VS GraphQL
    - GraphQL building blocks
    - How to use GraphQL in Python (list of libraries etc.)
    - Example - Creating basic schema and querying using *graphene*
    - Best practices & Conclusion.
